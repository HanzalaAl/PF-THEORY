PROBLEM 1 

//take speed in km/s as input from user
PRINT("Enter The value of speed in km/s: ")
INPUT speedkm

//Convert kilometers per second to meters per second.Multiply the speed by 1000
speedms = speedkm * 1000

//Convert meters per second to miles per hour.Multiply the speed by 2.237
speedmiles = speedms * 2.237

PRINT(speedmiles)

PROBLEM 2

//take a number input from user
PRINT("Enter A number:")
INPUT NUM

//check if the number is less than or equals to zero
   IF NUM <= 0 THEN:
      PRINT("Invalid input: Number must be positive")
      INPUT NUM 

// check if the number is divisible by 2 with remainder 0 . if yes than number is even . if no than number is odd
   ELSE IF NUM MOD 2 = 0 THEN:
      PRINT("Number is Even")
   ELSE 
      PRINT("Number is Odd")
