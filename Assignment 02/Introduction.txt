During my journey of Assignment 02,
I encountered several challenges, including syntax errors, 
logical flaws, and difficulty in debugging complex functions. 
To address these problems, I adopted a systematic approach: 
first, I carefully reviewed the code line by line to identify errors, 
utilized print statements to trace variable values, 
and consulted online resources and documentation for guidance. 
Through persistent troubleshooting and testing, I was able to refine my solutions. 
This experience taught me the importance of patience and resilience in programming, 
as well as the value of seeking help and utilizing debugging tools effectively.
